Answer 1

In case of i++ first the value is assigned and then it is incremented in other words ++ before i means incrementation must be carried out before assignment.
Whereas in case of ++i first the value get incremented and then get assigned i.e. ++ after i means incrementation must be carried out after assignment.

let a
let i=0
a=i++
console.log("after i++",a,i)
i=0
a=++i
console.log("after ++i",a,i)

output
 
after i++ 0 1
after ++i 1 1
