Answer 2

There is two way to access an index in string using square bracket notation or charAt.

If we access an index beyond range using square bracket notation we get undefined where using charAt nothing is desplayed just an empty space.

If we pass a negative index we get the same output as passing an index beyond range using square bracket notation we get undefined where using charAt nothing is desplayed just an empty space.
